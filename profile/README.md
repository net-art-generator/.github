The net.art generator is a computer program which collects and recombines material from the Internet to create a new
website or a new image. The WWW-interface of the easy-to-use program requires the user to enter a title which then
functions as the search term, and to enter a name as author.

Since 1997 five different versions of the net.art generator have been realized in collaboration with seven programers: nag_01 to nag_05.
